    <!--
      This is the single HTML entry point for the React app. 
      It should be the only HTML file in the project. Everything else is handled by React.

      Purpose:
      - Supply a stable mount node (<div id="root">) where React will render the component tree.
      - Load the client-side bundle/module that boots the React application (src/main.jsx).

      Notes:
      - Keep this file minimal â€” all app UI lives in React components under /src.
      - Do not remove or rename the #root element unless you also change the React mount target.
